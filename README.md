## Strucure

The data will be organized into the following subsections.

* Wireless Studies

Contain notes, publications etc on wireless networks and traffic such as data frames etc. Part of this project is to understand wirless networks so some ground work must be done to understand the protocols and messages sent so we can understand it better when we start analyzing traffic.

* Wireless traffic analysis

This will contain technical notes and tools ( over time ) to conduct research on wireless traffic.

It is also hoped that this section will include papers, articles, tutorials on advanced usage and scripting of wireshark etc.

* Wireless Security

This section will host papers, articles on the latest in wireless security.
